If you must use a remote connection, due to the length of time it takes for some of the steps, it's highly recommended to run them inside a virtual console like [TMUX](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) or [SCREEN](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/).

It is recommended to perform the next steps local to the machine, and **not** via a remote connection.
