## Get your token

Make sure you have copied your personal single-use authorization token from the [**Node Hosting signup page**](https://www.storj.io/host-a-node). It looks like this:

![The entire string, including your email is your auth token.](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/kv3plx2xmXcUGcVl4Lttj/jKgCrF0NC1sP8vXkcW8e4_screen-shot-2022-05-26-at-113436-am.png)

{% callout type="info"  %} 
If you do not have an authorization token yet,  [**sign up to Hosting a node.**](https://registration.storj.io)
{% /callout %}

By using your authorization token, you agree to the [Storage Node Operator Terms and Conditions](https://storj.io/storj-operator-terms).
