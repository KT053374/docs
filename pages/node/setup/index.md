## Introduction

By becoming a Storage Node Operator you enable your unused hard drive space to be accessible by the Storj storage services. Once your node is up and running you will be compensated in STORJ for any storage and bandwidth usage accessing your node.

You need to get an Authorization Token to setup your node.

Most, if not all ISPs give a dynamic IP address, which means your IP can change at any time. As a workaround, you need a dynamic DNS service to ensure your storage node is connected.

This is a protocol based on UDP which promises more efficient usage of the internet connection with parallel downloads and uploads[.]()

This can take several hours or days, depending on your machine's processing power and luck. Plan to run your Node on a NAS, Raspberry Pi, or similar? Create your identity on a more powerful machine and transfer it over.&#x20;
