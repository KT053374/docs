Storj DCS currently offers a free level of access for developers to try out the service. When a customer creates a new account, the user automatically is able to use the Storj DCS service at no cost up to specified limits of service. The free level of service is limited to the level of service for a single project as described below:

- 25GB of static object storage for a single project.

- 25GB of download bandwidth per month for a single project.

- 10,000 segments in total for all projects.

Usage for Static Object Storage and Download Bandwidth is calculated in the same way for the Free Plan as for the Pro Plan. A credit against billing will be applied each month for the Free Plan usage for as long as the Free Plan is offered. Accounts using the Free Plan of service are subject to [](docId:Zrbz4XYhIOm99hhRShWHg).
